# Bring the Action: Using GraalVM in Production

GraalVM has been around for a while, and more and more developers and teams are using it to run Java applications faster, more efficiently, and more securely. According to the latest “State of Spring” survey, 37% of Spring users either already run applications natively compiled GraalVM in production, or are currently evaluating it, and 31% more have such plans.<br><br>
For those who haven’t moved to GraalVM yet though, the questions and concerns are usually similar: how hard is it to migrate? Can I use my libraries and tools? How do I deploy and monitor such native applications? What about using the latest Java features?<br><br>
In this hands-on session, we’ll talk about all the practical aspects of building and running applications with GraalVM, tooling, monitoring, and using popular libraries, and cover common questions that we get from users.
